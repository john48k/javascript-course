    <p>
      A variable is like a container that holds a value. You can think of it as
      a labeled box where you can store information,
      <br />
      such as a number or a piece of text, and use it later in your program.
      <br />
      Variables help you keep track of data and make your code more flexible and
      easier to understand.
